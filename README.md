# Project Solar System :ringed_planet:

Hi!

This is my solar system project, developed while studying the second module (front-end development) at Trybe. It is my very first project made with React.

## Technologies

This project was developed using CSS, JavaScript, React and Jest (NodeJS).

## Developed skills

- Practice on using JSX on React;
- Practice on using the render() method to render the components;
- Practice on using the import to bring the components in different files;
- Practice on creating class components;
- Practice on creating multiple components from an array;
- Practice on using props and PropTypes to validate them;
